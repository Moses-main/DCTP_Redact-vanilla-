# Redact Text Web Application

This is a simple web application that allows users to redact certain words from a piece of text. It can be useful for obscuring sensitive information before sharing content on social media or other platforms.

## How it Works

Users can input a piece of text into the "Text to Redact" field and specify the words they want to redact in the "Words to Redact" field (separated by spaces). They can also specify a replacement character or word in the "Replacement Character/Word" field (optional).

After entering the necessary information, users can click the "Redact Now" button to process the text. The specified words will be replaced with the chosen replacement character/word. The original text, as well as the words that were changed and their replacements, will be displayed in the results section below.
